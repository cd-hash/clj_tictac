# Clj Tic-Tac-Toe

## Goals

My goal with this project was to implement a functionally similar version of
[Elixr-tictac](https://github.com/cd-hash/elixir_tictac) but following Clojures
version of Functional Programming. This meant not using pattern matching to the
extent that Elixir uses it and implementing error handling through exceptions.
